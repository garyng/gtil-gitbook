# Introduction

Just a place for me to jot down random notes / questions / solutions / thoughts / what I learned...

Previously using [vue-ghpages-blog](https://github.com/viko16/vue-ghpages-blog), but found GitBook is a much better choice.

This book is published on [GitHub Pages](https://garyng.github.io/gtil-gitbook/) (using Travis CI) and [Gitbook](https://garyng.gitbooks.io/gtil/content/).
