# Post Template and Conventions

## Writing
1. Use a blank line for new line instead of two spaces at the end
2. # Post Title in H1
3. ## Sub headers in H2, H3,...


## Posts/Files/Folders Naming Convention
1. Save posts in folder by `category` (C# posts in `C Sharp`, etc...)
2. Use Title Case for folder name if possible (`C Sharp` instead of `csharp`, `VS Code` instead of `vscode`)
3. Use lowercase for `category`
4. Save images used by post under folder `images/posts/<post-file-name>`
5. Images that doesn't belong to any post go under `images/`

## Post Template
> `H1` Post Title  
> `H2` Solution  
> `H2` Reference  
> `H2` See Also  
> ..
